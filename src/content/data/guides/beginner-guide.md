# Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Venus Island! This guide will help you get started with DOAXVV.

## Getting Started

When you first start the game, you'll be introduced to the Owner system. As the Owner, you'll manage the girls on Venus Island and help them participate in various activities.

### Your First Steps

1. Complete the tutorial to understand basic mechanics
2. Claim your starter rewards from the mailbox
3. Do your first gacha pull with the free tickets

## Understanding Currency

DOAXVV has several currencies you need to know:

### V-Stones
- Premium currency used for gacha pulls
- Can be earned through events, daily missions, and achievements
- 2500 V-Stones = 1 ten-pull

### Zack Coins
- Standard currency for shop purchases
- Earned from matches and daily activities

### Guest Points
- Social currency from friend interactions
- Used in the Guest Point shop

## Basic Gameplay Loop

Your daily routine should include:

1. **Daily Missions** - Complete for V-Stones and items
2. **Events** - Participate for exclusive rewards
3. **Matches** - Build relationships and earn currency
4. **Owner Room** - Increase closeness with girls

## Tips for New Players

- Save V-Stones for limited banners
- Focus on one or two girls initially

- Check the shop daily for good deals
