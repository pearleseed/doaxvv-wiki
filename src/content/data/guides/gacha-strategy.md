# Gacha Pull Strategy

When to pull and when to save for maximum SSR rates.

## Understanding Rates

### Base Rates
- SSR: 3.3%
- SR: 17%
- R: 79.7%

### Pity System
- Guaranteed SSR at 100 pulls
- Pity counter resets after SSR
- Pity does NOT carry between banners

## Banner Types

### Limited Banners
- Time-limited swimsuits
- Higher priority for pulling
- May not return for months

### Permanent Banners
- Always available swimsuits
- Lower priority
- Can be obtained from tickets

### Step-Up Banners
- Discounted first pulls
- Guaranteed rewards at steps
- Good value for V-Stones

## Pull Strategies

### The Patient Approach
- Save until you can hit pity
- Only pull on must-have banners
- Maximize value per V-Stone

### The Opportunist
- Pull on good step-up deals
- Stop at first SSR
- Spread pulls across banners

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself before pulling:
1. Is this swimsuit limited?
2. Do I have enough for pity?
3. Is there a better banner coming?
4. Do I actually want this swimsuit?

## Common Mistakes

- Pulling singles instead of 10-pulls
- Chasing after every new banner
- Not tracking pity counter
- Pulling without a budget
